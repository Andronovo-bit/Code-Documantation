## .NET Frameworks

There are many different .NET frameworks available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Some of the most popular .NET frameworks include:

| Framework | Description |
|-----|---|
| .NET Framework  | ![Image of .NET Framework logo](../../../static/img/net-framework.png#thumbnail) The original .NET framework, which is still widely used for building Windows applications. It is a managed execution environment that provides a standard set of APIs for building applications. |
| .NET Core | ![Image of .NET Core logo](../../../static/img/core-logo_white_border.png#thumbnail) A cross-platform version of the .NET Framework, which is designed to run on Windows, macOS, Linux, and other operating systems. It is a smaller and more lightweight framework than the .NET Framework, which makes it ideal for building applications that need to be portable. |
| .NET Standard | ![Image of .NET Standard logo](../../../static/img/ASP.net_.png#thumbnail) A set of APIs that are common to all .NET frameworks, which allows developers to write applications that can run on any .NET platform. This makes it easy to build applications that can be used on a variety of devices and operating systems. |
| Xamarin | ![Image of Xamarin logo](../../../static/img/xamarin-logo-png-transparent-1024x912.png#thumbnail)  A framework for building cross-platform mobile applications. It allows developers to use C# to build applications that can run on iOS, Android, and macOS. |
| Unity | ![Image of Unity logo](../../../static/img/3048561-middle.png#thumbnail) A framework for building cross-platform games. It allows developers to use C# to build games that can run on Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and other platforms. |
| .NET Maui | ![Image of Maui logo](../../../static/img/maui.png#thumbnail) A new cross-platform framework for building native mobile and desktop applications with C# and XAML. It is a successor to Xamarin Forms and is designed to be more modern, performant, and extensible. |
