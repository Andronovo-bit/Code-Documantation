# How to create a simple .NET app

In this section, you'll learn how to create a simple .NET console app that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. You'll use the .NET SDK and the .NET CLI tools to create and run the app.

Here is a video I want to share with you:

## Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial, you need to have the .NET SDK installed on your computer. You can download and install the .NET SDK from [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download).

You also need a code editor of your choice. You can use Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, or any other editor that supports .NET development.

## Create the app

First, open a terminal such as PowerShell, Command Prompt, or bash. Navigate to a folder where you want to create your app. Then, type the following command:

```bash
dotnet new console -o HelloWorld
```

This command creates a new console app project named "HelloWorld" in a subfolder with the same name. The project contains a single C# file named Program.cs with the following code:

```csharp
using System;

namespace HelloWorld
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
        }
    }
}
```

This code defines a namespace called HelloWorld, a class called Program, and a method called Main. The Main method is the entry point of the app, where it writes "Hello World!" to the console using the Console.WriteLine method.

## Run the app

To run the app, navigate to the project folder and type the following command:

```bash
dotnet run
```

This command builds and runs the app. You should see the following output:

```bash
Hello World!
```

Congratulations! You've created and run your first .NET app.
